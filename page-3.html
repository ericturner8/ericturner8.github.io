<h1>Ferrari LaFerrari</h1>
<hr>
<p>There is a certain level of prestige and excellence that, arguably, can only be matched by Rolls Royce when discussing Ferrari.  There aren't many people who would not want to own one, the materials and craftsmanship is top-notch.  My favorite example of this is the "LaFerrari".  This example is one of what it is believed to be around 900 models produced.  It was one of the first "Hypercars", where they integrate a battery pack for instant torque and horsepower off the line in combination with a gas engine to keep it going once the battery is maxed out.  These truly are an engineering marvel, but also absolutely beautiful. </p>
