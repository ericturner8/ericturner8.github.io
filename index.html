<hr>
<p>One of my greatest interests is cars.  Cars have always held a special place to me and always intrigued me.  I hope to eventually work for an auto manufacturer so that I could pursue my interests as a career.  I know that if I did something like that I would love going to work every day, and love doing my job, therefore producing better work.</p>
