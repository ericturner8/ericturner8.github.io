<h1>Mclaren P1</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Mclaren P1 is like the LaFerrari in that it is a hybrid to help with off the line speed, especially because it is rear-wheel drive.  I love the aggressive styling and the beautiful fully exposed carbon fiber.  In addition to the hybrid technology, this car features "active aero", which means that it has features, like the wing, that moves due to the speed, air condition and other factors.  This is another very limited production vehicle so I was lucky to get to take these pictures at the dealership close to me.</p>
