<h1>Koenigsegg One:1</h1>
<hr>
<p>My all time favorite car is the Koenigsegg One:1.  There is something about the exclusivity of it, and the lines and raw power that makes it my favorite.  It was the first production vehicle to have a one to one power to weight ratio, hence the name.  There were only 7 examples produced, and one was a company only production.  There is only one in North America and I was lucky enough to be able to see it in person.  There is a dealership five minutes from my house in Illinois that had it when I went and took pictures.  That dealership is one of three in the entire United States.  Seeing my dream car in person was a truly exciting time. </p>
